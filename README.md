---Features---

Myreads is a library application that allows you to find and store books. Books can
be stored in one of three categories. They are: read, want to read, and currently reading.
Inside the app you can change each books directory whenever you want by clicking on
the green circle in the bottom right corner of the book. Add a book you didn't mean to?
Simply click the green circle and select none, this will remove the book from your library.
If you wish to add a book click on the + icon in the bottom right corner of the screen. This
will take you to the search area where you can find books based on a query. To add a book to
your library you simply follow the same steps as if you were moving books around.
